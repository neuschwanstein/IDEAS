- Francois' Problem :: Given an infinite numbers of classifiers, what is the optimal way
     of sampling events so that we can apply a confidence bound on what to expect
     (Francois' Problem: a possibly infinite list of websites can make bid requests that
     are to be logged. The distribution has fat tails, and sampling is limited, but the
     number of outcomes is not).
- Learn all of Mathematics :: Given properly formatted definitions and theorems
     (eg. Principia Mathematica, or perhaps a very rigorous textbook, like Bourbaki would
     do), train a machine on it so it can output /real/ proofs for theorems.
- Reverse Engineer PDF :: To do so, starting with arxiv, reverse engineer PDF to their
     original LaTeX source, using perhaps PDF as png image? What feature should be used
     lead to a good representation of a pdf file? Then using a comprehensive model, train
     upon hundreds of thounsands of pdf (from a torrent eg.) to /learn/ all of the world
     knowledge !!
